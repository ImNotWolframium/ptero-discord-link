# ptero-discord-link
## About The Project

I am pretty sure someone already did this somewhere, but I am trying to make the best discord bot for linking your Pterodactyl panel to your discord server. This will be useful for hostings that just want an easy and intuitive way to manage their servers right from their Discord.

## Getting Started

Check out [the documentation](https://github.com/ImNotWolframium/ptero-discord-link/wiki) to find out how to set the bot up.

## Roadmap
